# A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each 
# containing an identical light bulb or light globe. Each light is 
# connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb 
# is switched off at present. You are outside the room, and the door 
# is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the 
# light switches as many times as you like. But once you've opened 
# the door, you may no longer touch a switch. After this, you go into 
# the room and examine the lights. 
# How can you tell which switch goes to which light?

Turn on the first one, then wait around 5 mins or a certain amount of time for it to get hot so you can see which one it is by touching it. turn on the second and last and go in and touch whichever is the hottest one.












# A farmer is on his way back from the market, with him he has a fox, 
# a chicken and some grain. When he reaches a river crossing he must 
# use a small boat only big enough for him and one other item. 
# Unfortunately if the fox is left alone with the chicken it will eat it, 
# as will the chicken eat the grain. Explain how the farmer can cross the river.
