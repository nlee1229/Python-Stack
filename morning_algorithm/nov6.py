# You are to open a safe without knowing the combination. Beginning with 
# the dial set at zero, the dial must be turned counter-clockwise to the 
# first combination number, (then clockwise back to zero), and clockwise 
# to the second combination number, (then counter-clockwise back to zero), 
# and counter-clockwise again to the third and final number, where upon 
# the door shall immediately spring open. There are 40 numbers on the dial, 
# including the zero.

# Without knowing the combination numbers, what is the maximum number of 
# trials required to open the safe (one trial equals one attempt to dial 
# a full three-number combination)?

# Adam, Bob, Clair and Dave are out walking: They come to rickety old 
# wooden bridge. The bridge is weak and only able to carry the weight 
# of two of them at a time. Because they are in a rush and the light 
# is fading they must cross in the minimum time possible and must carry 
# a torch (flashlight,) on each crossing.

# They only have one torch and it can't be thrown. Because of their 
# different fitness levels and some minor injuries they can all cross 
# at different speeds. 

# Adam can cross in 1 minute, 
# Bob in 2 minutes, 
# Clair in 5 minutes and 
# Dave in 10 minutes.

# Adam, the brains of the group thinks for a moment and declares that 
# the crossing can be completed in 17 minutes. There is no trick. How is this done?

First, 1 & 2 cross the bridge. =Total of 2 min. Then 1 goes back, which makes it total of 3 min.
